# Backend Boilerplate with JWT, Passport OAuth, and TypeDI Overview

This project is a robust backend boilerplate designed to provide a solid foundation for web applications requiring authentication. It features:

 - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication

 - Passport.js with Google OAuth 2.0 for social authentication

 - TypeDI for elegant dependency injection

 - MongoDB with Mongoose for data persistence

 - Winston for logging

 - Express as the web framework

This boilerplate is ideal for developers who want to kickstart projects with production-ready authentication systems without building from scratch.

# Key Features

**Authentication**

 - JWT Authentication: Secure token-based authentication with jsonwebtoken

 - Google OAuth 2.0: Social login integration using Passport.js

 - Session Management: Redis-backed session storage for scalability (preferably)

 - Security: Helmet middleware for enhanced security headers

**Architecture**

 - TypeDI: Clean dependency injection pattern for better code organization

 - Modular Structure: Well-organized codebase following best practices

 - Environment Configuration: Dotenv for environment variable management

# Development Tools

* TypeScript: Strong typing for better developer experience

* ts-node-dev: Hot reloading for development

* Comprehensive Logging: Winston logger with customizable transports

# Getting Started

* Prerequisites
 - Node.js (v18 or higher)

 - MongoDB

 - Redis (preferably)

 - Google OAuth credentials

* Installation

**Why This Boilerplate?**

This project stands out because:

 - It combines multiple authentication strategies in a cohesive way

 - Uses TypeDI for clean dependency management

 - Implements best practices for security and scalability

 - Provides a solid foundation that can be extended for various use cases

**Future Improvements**

I plan to enhance this project with:

 - Additional OAuth providers (Facebook, GitHub, etc.)

 - Two-factor authentication

 - Rate limiting

 - Enhanced documentation

 - More example routes and controllers
